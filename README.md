## This is the frontend for the Rover Image Viewer

 - This is built using Vite + React
 - To keep things quick I've used bootstrap UI
 - Used useeffect to make requests to the laravel API
 - State is used to manage the modal image, filter options for the rovers, loading state and the response from the API

Things I would improve
 - Images from the Opportunity and Sprint return a webpage instead of an image. If I had time I would have created logic to handle how its displayed
 - Create components rather than putting it one file
 - Used https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/frontend#inertia to keep the codebase in one repo rather 2. For the sake of simplicity and meeting the allocated time I've decided to split it.
 - Better git branching strategy rather than pushing it all into main.
 - I would use native JavaScript for a simple task like this rather than using React.
